# CV_PROJECT
The repository contains code for my computer vision course project.
I am not including my photo and video used to test the application of this model due to privacy concerns.

I trained a Siamese Neural Network for face similarity matching. The application of this model is taking attendance, tracking a person in cctv footage and many others.
I used pre-trained EfficientNetV2S model for feature extraction.

Computer_Vision_Model.ipynb - Contains code for data preparation as well training the model.

Computer_Vision_Model_1.ipynb - Also Contains code for implementing trained model for real world application.

Trained model and training data is available here:
