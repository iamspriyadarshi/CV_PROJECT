# CV_PROJECT
The repository contains code for my computer vision course project.
I am not including my photo and video used to test the application of this model due to privacy concerns.

I trained a Siamese Neural Network for face similarity matching. The application of this model is taking attendance, tracking a person in cctv footage and many others.
I used pre-trained EfficientNetV2S model for feature extraction.

Computer_Vision_Model.ipynb - Contains code for data preparation as well training the model.

Computer_Vision_Application.ipynb - Contains code for utilizing the trained model for tracking a person presence. With a slight modification in the code can be used for a lot of applications.

Trained model and training data is available here:
